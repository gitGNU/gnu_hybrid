## NOTE:
##   Multiboot compliance force us to have the multiboot header first so we
##   must split the architecture level sources into arch_SRCS and
##   arch_multiboot_SRCS.
##
##   Another trick to enforce the multiboot compliance is available inside the
##   kernel linker script
##
## XXX FIXME:
##   Both solutions are quite awful, we should find a better solution ASAP
