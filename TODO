NOTE:
	TODOs are divided in three parts: TO-BE-DONE, DONE and DONE-RECHECK.

	TODOs in TO-BE-DONE are ordered in a least-to-last important order.
	Take in charge whatever TODO you like to complete but remember that
	the least important are probably the blocking ones ... so they should
	be completed first ...

	When a TODO in TO-BE-DONE has been completed it must be moved to DONE
	or DONE-RECHECK if it needs further checking.

	In DONE and DONE-RECHECK a date or a release version (the same that
	the ChangeLog shows) number should be added too (in order to remember
	when that TODO has been declared completed ...

TO-BE-DONE:
* Move less useful tools related parameters from src/Makefile.am to
  src/Makefile.am

* We should use AC_CHECK_TOOL instead of AC_PATH_PROG machineries that we have
  This approach should handle cross-compilation cases.

* tools/scripts/test-*: Remove test files (test-*.txt) when the test runs
  smoothly (XFAIL case).

* tools/autotools/m4/ax_string_intersect.m4: Fix the bug, its description is
  in the macro.

* Add a test in the `make check' target in order to avoid the use of multibyte
  character ('\') in sed substitution command (s///) in order to gain more
  portability (ex. do not use things like this: `sed -e 's/^.*/\t/' on
  FreeBSD).

* tools/scripts/map2ie.awk.in, tools/scripts/symsdump.awk.in: Fix the errors
  when the kernel get stripped and a 'make' is issued on the tree. The error
  is:

    /usr/bin/nm: kernel: no symbols

* Move the src/archs/ia32/keyboard* related code to a i8042.* file.

* Fix the modules build problem when compiling with bfd version 2.15 (on
  FreeBSD host ld exits with segmentation fault).

* tools/scripts/*.awk.in: Remove all code that depends on 'for (x in y)' or our
  regression tests will fail.

* Add regression tests for tools/scripts awk libraries

* Remove configure link in src/arch (it is not portable). Remove the LN_S check
  in configure.ac

* complete debugger completion in kernel/dbg/debugger/completion.c

* tools/scripts/*.awk: Start using the strerror() function to display all the
  system errors.

* tools/scripts/*.awk: Fix the common behaviour when RS="" ... at the present
  all is broken.

* tools/autotools/m4/ax_asm_uscore.m4: Fix the test, it is really crappy and
  it will work only for gcc...

* tools/scripts/Makefile.am: Complete pass 2 in check-local target (check for
  detecting function calls with spaces between function-name and parentheses).
  Don't leave white spaces before the parentheses in user functions calls; GNU
  awk will reject it.

* tools/scripts/*.awk: Change all external programs invocations from long
  arguments to short arguments (in order to be more portable)

* src/include/config.h: Remove the #ifndef ASM ...

* tools/scripts/*.awk: Add checks in order to detect when a parameter is
  specified multiple times (like -P in ifdefscheck.awk).

* tools/scripts/Makefile.am: Fix the 'check' target ... it is not reporting
  duplicated symbols...

* Use AC_CHECK_TOOL instead of AC_PATH_PROG for nm, objdump and so on in
  configure.ac.

* Reenable the -f (fatal) flag on tools/scripts/symscheck.awk and
  tools/scripts/ifdefscheck.awk (and other tools too) in src/Makefile.am.

* Fix the "protect" variable in tools/scripts/Makefile.am in order to protect
  even the ' character.

* Check in tools/scripts/*.in the awk scripts in order to verify that:

     If you want your program to be deterministic, don't depend on `for'
     on arrays:

          $ cat for.awk
          END {
            arr["foo"] = 1
            arr["bar"] = 1
            for (i in arr)
              print i
          }
          $ gawk -f for.awk </dev/null
          foo
          bar
          $ nawk -f for.awk </dev/null
          bar
          foo

* Fix the dependencies in src/Makefile.am. Example:

    include/config/userconfig.h: Makefile $(CFG_OUTPUT) $(SH2H)
	    $(SH2H) USERCONFIG_H < $(CFG_OUTPUT) > include/config/userconfig.h

  should be

    include/config/userconfig.h: Makefile $(CFG_OUTPUT) $(SH2H).in
	    $(SH2H) USERCONFIG_H < $(CFG_OUTPUT) > include/config/userconfig.h

  but $(SH2H).in is created in tools/scripts directory ... these dependencies
  are completely useless ... but must be retained in order to rebuild the
  target if the tool is changed

* src/dbg/debugger/builtin-commands.c: Add the sub-command functionality in
  order to have commands like 'memory pmm' and 'memory heap' instead of
  'pmm' and 'heap' separately (like gdb commands).

* src/*: We should replace lot of asserts with proper checks (and expect()
  calls). We should remove all the useless asserts.

* src/libs/c/stdio.c: Fix all return values (and all the referencing
  functions).

* src/libs/c/stdio.c: Fix eof and error indicator in streams.

* Add a check in 'check' target in order to see if panic() gets called with
  some '\n' (only at end of line).

* src/libs/debug/gdb.c: Adde support for kernel debugging via GDB (GDB
  requires serial line support ... */

* src/Makefile.am: The config target doesn't handle its dependencies ...

* configure.ac: Add all the needed tests in order to check for required GCC
  features (like __builtin_* for stdarg.h macros).

* tools/ids2def/pci2def, tools/ids2def/usb2def: Add code for the remaining
  classes/devices etc. etc.

* configure.ac: Fix the checks for needed and wanted packages (they should
  bail-out or printing a message then stop/continue depending on what we need
  to do ...

* Makefile.ams: Add the maintainer-check rule

* In order to avoid automake problems follow the following rules for all
  Makefile.am:

	> Hello,
	>   I've just stumbled over this problem:
	> Makefile.am contains:
	>
	> foo.h: foo.x
	>       $(GENERATOR) foo.x >foo.h
	>
	> But the GENERATOR command failed and I have empty foo.h.

	Use a temporary file and rename that afterwards.

* configure.ac: Add more Doxygen related checks.
